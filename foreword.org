The Common Lisp Cookbook is a collaborative resource to help you learn
Common Lisp the language, its ecosystem and to get you started in a
wide range of programming areas. It can be used by Lisp newcomers as a
tutorial (getting started, functions, etc) and by everybody as a
reference (loop!).

We hope that these EPUB and PDF versions make the learning experience
even more practical and enjoyable.
